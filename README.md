# Statistical analysis for a randomised controlled trial (RCT)
<p>This workbook contains code for analysing a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in which participants with type 2 diabetes were randomized to one of two groups: "Control" (placebo) or "Treatment" (a glucose-lowering drug). In both groups, blood glucose ("BloodGlucose") was measured before and after 12 weeks.
<p>The data is fictional and was simulated.
<p>The null hypothesis was that there is no difference between the effect of treatment and the effect of control on blood glucose. The alternate hypothesis was that treatment improves (lowers) blood glucose more than control.
<p>The following statistical approaches were used to compare between-group changes in blood glucose:
<ul>
<li>Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA.
<li>Linear mixed modeling.
<li>Bayesian modeling.
<ul>
